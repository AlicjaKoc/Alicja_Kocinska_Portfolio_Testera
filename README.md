### ABOUT ME

Software testing is something I want to do today until retirement :wink: 

Why testing? I have always been comfortable with the computer, and have used it in a wide range of ways - from the usual Office, through graphics or CAD type programs to games, especially my favorite RPG. And I guess it's my way of going through these games that perfectly shows that testing is something just for me - I never limit myself to the main story line, I try to complete all side missions and explore the game world.

Previous work experience has developed in me qualities useful in this profession. 
I focus on development, I independently deepen the knowledge outlined during my studies: I use subject literature, thematic webinars, blogs, etc., especially valuing Cherry-IT initiatives and meetings of the Tri-City testing community 3QA.

__I am currently a mentee in the eighth edition of the Tech Leaders mentoring program.__

### POSTMAN PROJECT

Project for the end of postgraduate studies done in a three-person team: "Design and execution of manual functional tests for API of Tristar sytem".
The work consisted of designing functional tests for the API of the Tristar Integrated Traffic Management System. The purpose of the work was to prepare a test plan, test cases and scenarios to ensure optimal (in the opinion of the testers) coverage of the functionalities offered by the API. To create and execute the tests, the chosen tool for manual execution of requests had to be used - we chose Postman. Project done in Polish.
